---

## 2. VISUAL DESIGN DIRECTION

### Color Palette: Earth & Heritage

**Primary Colors** (Foundation)

- **Deep Indigo (#1a2847)** — Symbol of Balochi textiles, depth, tradition. Use for primary CTA, headers, key navigation

- **Burnt Sienna (#8b4513)** — Balochi embroidery staple, warmth, handcrafted feel. Use for accents, borders, secondary buttons

- **Off-White/Cream (#f5f1ed)** — Luxury whitespace, reduces strain on handwoven/embroidered product photography. Primary background

- **Charcoal Black (#2a2a2a)** — Authority, text, structure. NOT pure black; maintains warmth

**Secondary Colors** (Heritage Accent)

- **Deep Red/Maroon (#8b1a1a)** — Traditional Balochi red, reserved for hero sections, limited-edition badges, or seasonal emphasis

- **Warm Sand (#d4b9a0)** — Balochi textiles natural yarn, use for borders, dividers, lighter accents

- **Deep Teal (#2d5a5a)** — Secondary embroidery tradition, use sparingly for complementary CTAs or premium tier indicators

**Neutral Support**

- **Medium Gray (#b0a8a0)** — Secondary text, meta information, non-critical UI

- **Light Gray (#e8e4df)** — Subtle backgrounds, borders, dividers

### Color Application Rules

| Element | Color | Reasoning |

| --------- | ------- | ----------- |

| Primary CTA (Buy, Add to Cart) | Deep Indigo | High authority, trust, clear intention |

| Hover/Active States | Burnt Sienna | Warmth, craft feeling, gentle intensity |
| Premium/Rare Badges | Deep Red + Gold accent | Heritage prestige, limited availability |

| Text Body | Charcoal Black | Readability, warmth, sophistication |
| Secondary CTAs | Burnt Sienna | Lower priority but still heritage-grounded |

| Prices/Meta Info | Medium Gray | De-emphasize commercial aspect, focus on product |
| Dividers/Borders | Warm Sand | Organic feel, respects visual whitespace |

| Hero Backgrounds | Off-White/Cream | Maximum focus on product photography |
| Loading States/Transitions | Burnt Sienna | Feels intentional, not generic |

| Error/Alert | Deep Red | Tradition-grounded warning, not alarming |

### Contrast & Luxury Rules

**Light Combinations:**

- Off-White background + Charcoal text = 12.5:1 contrast (WCAG AAA, excellent readability)

- Off-White background + Deep Indigo CTAs = 9.8:1 contrast (clear, premium)

**Dark Combinations:**

- Deep Indigo background + Off-White text = Reserved for hero sections, premium testimonials, brand moments

- Never use pure white on pure black (too harsh); use Off-White on Charcoal for warmth

**Saturation Principle:**

- Colors are *rich but not loud*

- Balochi textiles are naturally saturated yet muted; match this

- Avoid neon, pastel, or oversaturated versions

- Every color should feel like it came from a textile dyehouse

**Accent Color Discipline:**

- Deep Red used only 2-3 times per page maximum

- Acts as visual punctuation, not wallpaper

- When Deep Red appears, surround it with Off-White (breathing room)

---

## 3. TYPOGRAPHY DIRECTION

### Font Strategy: "Heritage Meets Modernity"

**Primary Display Font: "Lora" (Serif) or equivalent**

- *Why Serif?* Serifs convey heritage, editorial prestige, handcrafted quality

- Used for: H1 headings, brand lockup, hero statements, product category titles

- Style: Regular weight for elegance, Bold only for key moments (never Extra-Bold)

- Line height: 1.3 (tighter, sophisticated)

- Letter spacing: Natural (no artificial expansion)

*Alternative: "Cormorant Garamond"* if Lora feels too digital — provides more classical prestige

**Secondary Display Font: "Inter" or "Poppins" (Modern Sans-Serif)**

- *Why Sans-Serif?* Balances tradition with accessibility, modern usage

- Used for: H2/H3 subheadings, navigation, UI elements, body text

- Style: Regular for body, Medium for secondary headings, SemiBold for emphasis

- Line height: 1.5 (breathing room, modern)

- Letter spacing: +0.3px for body text (luxury, not cramped)

### Typographic Hierarchy & Rules

| Element | Font | Weight | Size | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Color |

| --------- | ------ | -------- | ------ | ------------- | ----------------- | ------- |

| **H1** (Hero Statement) | Lora | Regular | 48-56px | 1.3 | 0 | Deep Indigo |

| **H2** (Section Title) | Lora | Regular | 36-40px | 1.3 | 0 | Deep Indigo |
| **H3** (Subsection) | Inter | SemiBold | 24-28px | 1.4 | 0 | Charcoal |

| **H4** (Minor Heading) | Inter | Medium | 18-20px | 1.4 | 0 | Charcoal |
| **Body Text** | Inter | Regular | 16px | 1.6 | +0.3px | Charcoal |

| **Caption** (Material, Origin) | Inter | Regular | 13-14px | 1.5 | +0.2px | Medium Gray |
| **Price/Meta** | Inter | Regular | 14px | 1.5 | 0 | Medium Gray |

| **Buttons/CTA** | Inter | Medium | 15-16px | 1.5 | +0.5px | Off-White on Indigo |
| **Product Tags** (Hand-embroidered, Rare) | Inter | SemiBold | 12px | 1.4 | +0.3px | Deep Indigo |

### Urdu/Regional Script Support

**Critical for Authenticity:**

- Display product names in *both* English and Urdu

- Use Urdu for heritage context, embroidery technique names, region of origin

- Font: "Noto Naskh Arabic" or "Urdu Typesetting" (system font)

- Urdu text should be equal visual weight to English — not smaller, not secondary

- Line height for Urdu: 1.8 (diacriticals require space)

- Placement: English above, Urdu directly below (or side-by-side if space allows)

**Example:**

``` text
Balochi Ajrak Shawl
بلوچی اجڑک شال
Hand-woven, 100% organic cotton, Gwadar origin

```

### Typography Principles

1. **Restraint** — Maximum 3 font weights per page (Regular, Medium, SemiBold)
2. **Whitespace** — Line height and letter spacing are more important than font choice
3. **Hierarchy clarity** — No ambiguity between heading levels
4. **Readability first** — Size never smaller than 14px for body, 12px for captions
5. **Heritage respect** — Urdu should never feel like a translation; it should feel native
6. **Luxury through space** — Generous margins and padding around text blocks
7. **No justification** — Use left-align for body text (respects word spacing)

---

## 4. UI & LAYOUT PRINCIPLES

### Whitespace Philosophy: "Breathing Room"

Whitespace is **not empty space**; it is **intentional silence** that lets products and heritage speak.

**Rules:**

- Minimum 40px margin between sections (mobile: 24px)

- Minimum 24px padding inside cards and containers

- Never fill vertical space just because it exists

- A page with 30% whitespace = premium; 10% whitespace = fast-fashion

- Use whitespace to create visual hierarchy more than color or size

### Grid System: Modular & Respectful

**Desktop Grid:**

- 12-column grid (standard, proven)

- Gutter: 24px between columns

- Container width: 1200px (respects readability and product imagery)

- Section padding: 80px vertical (luxury pacing)

**Tablet Grid:**

- 8-column grid

- Gutter: 16px

- Full-width sections with 32px side padding

**Mobile Grid:**

- 4-column grid

- Gutter: 12px

- Full-width with 16px side padding

- Stack-based layout (no complex grids)

### Homepage Layout Philosophy: "Editorial, Not Marketplace"

The homepage is a **cultural storytelling platform**, not a product listing warehouse.

**Recommended Section Order:**
1. **Hero Section** (Full-width, editorial)
   - Single hero image: Craftswoman/artisan at work OR full-body model in signature piece
   - Overlaid serif headline: "The Art of Balochi Heritage"
   - Tagline in Urdu + English
   - Single CTA: "Explore Collections" (not "Shop Now")
   - Background: Off-white or product image; minimal overlay

2. **Heritage Statement** (Full-width editorial block)
   - Single column, centered, max 600px width
   - Handwritten-style serif font
   - 200-300 words on Balochi cultural significance
   - No images; let text breathe
   - Background: Off-white

3. **Collections Grid** (4 cards on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile)
   - Cards: Large, minimal text overlay
   - Image: Full-bleed, 1:1 or 4:3 ratio, high-quality
   - Overlay: Subtle deep indigo gradient (bottom), white text
   - Collection name in Lora serif
   - Subtext: "Est. 1982" or "Hand-Woven" — provenance, not description
   - Hover: Slight image zoom, CTAs fade in

4. **Spotlight Product Section** (Seasonal/Limited)
   - Single product, full-width image left, details right
   - Storytelling copy: Origin story, artisan name, techniques, materials
   - Slow reveal (scroll-triggered animations)
   - Emotional, not transactional

5. **Craft Stories** (3-column card grid)
   - Small images (process photos, artisan portraits)
   - Titles: "Hand-Embroidery Techniques," "Indigo Dyeing Heritage," "The Gwadar Weavers"
   - Click to expand or link to blog
   - Preserve cultural respect; no clichéd "exotic" framing

6. **Testimonials** (Diaspora voices)
   - 2-3 quotes from international + local customers
   - No photos required; names + location enough
   - Deep Indigo background, Off-White text
   - Serif display of quote text

7. **Footer** (2-column approach)
   - Left: Brand story (150 words), mission statement
   - Right: Links (Collections, About, Craft Stories, Contact)
   - Secondary: Social, newsletter signup
   - Background: Charcoal or Deep Indigo

### Product Listing Aesthetics: "Image-First, Minimal Text"

**Product Card Structure:**

``` text
[HIGH-QUALITY IMAGE — 70% of card space]
[Collection tag: "Ajrak" or "Hand-Embroidered" — Burnt Sienna badge]
[Product name in Lora serif — 18px, Deep Indigo]
[Urdu name below in Noto Naskh — 14px, Medium Gray]
[Price in Medium Gray — smallest element]
[One-line detail: "Hand-woven, Organic Cotton" — 13px, Medium Gray]
[Hover: "View Details" CTA slides in — Deep Indigo button]

``` text

**Rules:**

- Images occupy 60-70% of vertical space

- Text occupies 30-40%

- Never show 10 products per row (shows indifference to quality)

- Desktop: 3 columns, Tablet: 2 columns, Mobile: 1 column

- Card height: 1:1 image ratio (square) — luxurious, not cramped

- Spacing between cards: 24px (breathes)

- No star ratings, no review counts (we build trust through storytelling, not crowds)

- **Filters on left sidebar** (desktop), collapsible (mobile) — organized but not overwhelming

### Product Detail Page Layout

**Image Section (Left, 55% width on desktop):**

- Hero image: Full-bleed, 1:1 ratio

- Gallery: 3-4 additional angles below hero

- Zoom on hover (not auto-zoom, user-initiated)

- Lifestyle shot at bottom (artisan/context)

- Background: Off-white

**Details Section (Right, 40% width on desktop):**

- Product name (Lora, 32px, Deep Indigo)

- Urdu name (Noto Naskh, 18px, Medium Gray)

- Price (Medium Gray, 18px, non-bold)

- Collection label (Burnt Sienna badge)

- Storytelling section (Max 100 words):
  - Origin: Where/when made
  - Materials: Specific details (e.g., "Organic cotton from Sindh")
  - Technique: Brief but respectful (e.g., "Hand-embroidered using traditional Balochi patterns")
  - Artisan: Name + region (if shared with customer permission)

- Size/Options (minimal selectors)

- **"Add to Wishlist" + "Add to Cart"** (Two CTAs, equal weight)

- Shipping + Return info (secondary text)

- Care instructions (expandable section)

- **Trust element**: "Certificate of Authenticity included"

---

## 5. CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS (CRITICAL)

### Respectful Presentation of Balochi Patterns & Embroidery

**DO:**

- Name every pattern accurately (consult with Balochi artisans/historians)

- Use Urdu names alongside English

- Link pattern to region/tradition origin (e.g., "Gwadar Ajrak" not just "Ajrak")

- Show close-up photography of embroidery detail (celebrates craftsmanship)

- Credit individual artisans or cooperatives (with permission)

- Explain technique without oversimplifying (e.g., not "tribal weaving" but "traditional indigo-resist weaving")

- Feature artisan stories (short video or narrative) on limited/premium pieces

- Mention UNESCO recognition or cultural significance where applicable

**DON'T:**

- Use words like "tribal," "exotic," "primitive," or "ethnic" (othering language)

- Apply Western beauty standards to Balochi aesthetics (e.g., "modernized" or "simplified for contemporary taste")

- Feature non-Balochi models in traditional pieces without clear context

- Use Balochi culture as backdrop for lifestyle aesthetic (avoid "boho-chic" styling)

- Over-explain patterns as if audience is unfamiliar (write for educated, curious audience)

- Reduce embroidery complexity to "handmade charm" (it's technical mastery)

- Photograph pieces in settings that misrepresent their cultural context (e.g., yoga studio shoot)

### Avoiding Over-Modernization

**The Core Principle:** Heritage + Modern = Heritage in Contemporary Life (not Modern Clothing with Heritage Details)

**Design Guardrails:**
1. **Color palette** — Stay true to Balochi natural dyes and traditional palettes; no neon or trendy colors
2. **Silhouettes** — If offering contemporary cuts, ensure they respect traditional proportions and coverage
3. **Embroidery placement** — Don't minimize or relocate embroidery for "clean aesthetic"; let it occupy proper space
4. **Material sourcing** — Prefer traditional materials (cotton, silk, wool) over synthetic blends; document this
5. **Technique authenticity** — Hand-embroidery remains hand-embroidery; no shortcuts for "luxury feel"
6. **Pricing** — Price reflects true craft value, not trend-chasing markup (transparency builds trust)

### Visual Storytelling for Heritage Products

**For Each Product Collection, Develop:**

1. **Origin Narrative** (50-75 words)
   - Geographic origin: "Woven in Gwadar by the Baloch Weavers Cooperative"
   - Historical context: "Ajrak patterns originate from 3rd century trade routes"
   - Cultural significance: "Worn in Balochi weddings for 200+ years"

2. **Technique Documentation** (Process imagery)
   - 3-5 behind-the-scenes photos showing craft steps
   - Optional: 60-second video (silent, meditative) of artisan working
   - Captions: Names of techniques in Urdu + English

3. **Artisan Profile** (If feasible; with permission)
   - Photo of artisan/cooperative
   - Name and region
   - Brief bio (2-3 sentences)
   - "This collection supports 15 women artisans in Turbat region"

4. **Material Provenance**
   - Specific sourcing: "Organic cotton from Sindh organic farms"
   - Dye sources: "Natural indigo from [supplier], sustainable harvesting"
   - Certifications: Organic, Fair Trade, etc.

5. **Cultural Context** (Educational, not patronizing)
   - When/how it's traditionally worn
   - Occasions and significance
   - Regional variations
   - Link to cultural calendar if applicable (weddings, festivals)

**Example Product Story Structure:**

``` text
PRODUCT: Balochi Wedding Shawl (Orhni)
ENGLISH NARRATIVE:
"This hand-woven orhni represents six months of work by master weavers
in the Gwadar region. Traditionally draped at Balochi weddings, each

   - "Regions of Balochistan: Craft Heritage"
   - Positions platform as authority, not vendor

8. **Clear Communication**

## VERSION CONTROL & DEPLOYMENT

This brand foundation is maintained in the SHALKAAR GitHub repository and serves as the single source of truth for all design decisions. All code changes are tracked via GitHub, with automated deployments to Vercel triggered from the main branch.

**Key Points:**

- Design specifications in this document are referenced during code review

- Color values, typography rules, and spacing tokens are hardcoded into the design system

- Changes to this foundation require team consensus and are merged via pull request

- Vercel automatically deploys the latest approved design system to production

---

## FINAL PRINCIPLE

**Every design decision should answer:**

> Does this honor Balochi heritage while making it accessible to the modern world?

If the answer is "no," revisit the decision. If the answer is uncertain, consult with Balochi cultural advisors before proceeding.

This is not a generic e-commerce platform. This is a **cultural archive and marketplace**, where heritage is the product, and luxury is the respect we show that heritage.
